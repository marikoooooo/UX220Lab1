## Hello!
 My name is Mariko Kitamura. The favorite thing that I have wrote is a birthday letter to my sister for her 12th birthday.

It is my favorite thing that I have wrote for her because I wrote about what it was like to be 12 and how she should not be scared of anything and that her family is always there for her.

Today she is 14 and it seems as though she has read my letter and understood the contents of it.
